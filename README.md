The badges above are for the upstream Fossify Messages app, not for bgsms.

## bgsms (this fork)

bgsms is a personal fork of Fossify Messages with extra features: flash SMS archiving, per-sender mute and auto-archive with exceptions, M-PESA balance blur, whole-message copy only, and a 60 day recycle bin.

It uses a patched copy of Fossify commons that removes the "fake version" warnings shown to forks. The patch lives in the `commons-bgsms` submodule and Gradle builds it automatically, so clone with submodules and build:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sudomastery/bgsms.git
cd bgsms
./gradlew assembleCoreRelease
```

If you already cloned without submodules, run `git submodule update --init`.
